- Responsive, robust UI with error handling
- Auto-close when Cemu closes (even if Cemu was started manually)

- No Python setup required for EXE versionâ€”just extract and run
- All config, mappings, and covers are portable and saved alongside the app
- Modern, clean UI with menu bar for advanced options
- Debug info and error log for troubleshooting

## How to Use

### 1. Setup
#### For EXE (Recommended for most users)
- Download the release ZIP from GitHub and extract all files to a folder
- **Navigate directly into the extracted folder** (not a parent folder)
- **Double-click `main.exe` (or `WiiPresenceU.exe` if renamed) to launch the app**
- On first launch, set your Cemu.exe path when prompted

#### For Python Script (Advanced/Developers)
- Download and extract all files to a folder
- Run `main.py` (not `WPU_UI.py`) (requires Python 3.8+, Pillow, pypresence, psutil, requests, beautifulsoup4, pywin32)
- On first launch, set your Cemu.exe path when prompted

### 2. Adding Custom Cover Art & Discord Assets
- Launch a game in Cemu
- If the game is unmapped, the app will automatically search Google Images for possible cover art.
- You can flip through up to 12 image results using the `Next Image` and `Previous Image` buttons directly below the cover art.
- When you find an image you like, click `Save as Discord Asset` to map it for future use.
- After saving, the navigation and save buttons will disappear and the new cover art will be used for both the UI and Discord Rich Presence.
- **Note:** You cannot upload your own custom asset images; only Google Images results can be used for cover art.

### 3. Editing Game Mappings
- You can manually edit `game_mappings.json` to add or change mappings
- Each entry: `[Display Name, Discord Asset Name, Activity/Detail, (optional) Cover Art Path]`

### 4. Using Your Own Discord Application
- Create a new application at https://discord.com/developers/applications
- Add your own image assets (name them as you wish)
- Enter your Client ID in the code (edit `CLIENT_ID` in `WPU_UI.py`)
- Use your asset names when adding custom cover art

### 5. Auto-Close Behavior
- Wii Presence U will automatically close itself whenever Cemu closes, even if you started Cemu manually.
- You do not need to launch Cemu from the app for this feature to work.

## Troubleshooting
- If you see errors, check `wpu_ui_error.log` for details
- You can clear the log by deleting the file

## Building an EXE (for developers)
- Use PyInstaller or similar tool to bundle the app:
  - Example: `pyinstaller --onefile --add-data "game_mappings.json;." --add-data "wpu_ui_config.json;." --add-data "icon.ico;." --add-data "custom_covers;custom_covers" WPU_UI.py`
- Make sure all data files are included in the same folder as the EXE
- The app will automatically find its data files when run as an EXE
